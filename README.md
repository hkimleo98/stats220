# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is a key component of my studies
- I am interested in learning about different perspectives to adopt when viewing and analysing data, and constructing data structures.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
